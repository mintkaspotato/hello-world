# hello-world
hello!

I am slowly becoming a coder, if you will. My time and health are precious - usually I keep myself busy knitting, googling stuff, pacing through various books on data/references 
(now it's Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 6th edition, and Head First C). My coding style is called all over the place and I tend to learn about things that would
come in handy. 

What I kinda know?
 - python (intermediate)
 - C (basicccccccc)
 - C++ (in theory intermediate as I used to code in it some more advanced stuff as a burned out teenager)
 - java (intermediate)
 - bash
 - some sql as needed


What I want to know?
 - I don't know
 - BUT I'd like to structure systems one day. Doesn't matter what kind as all of data is beautiful, but nasty

Daytime I work as an IT/Systems administrator which means I fight printers and VMs daily. People too, to certain extent. Most of them are lovely though!
